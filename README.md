# Paper_Machine_Learning_and_Forecasting_Elections
Code and Data for the paper "Machine Learning and Forecasting: Predicting the 2020 Presidential Election." 
A working draft of the paper can be found at my website: https://mawalz05.wixsite.com/website

The data contains both features and response variables to 2016. Data for the features for 2020 should be added prior to the 2024 presidential elections.
To train the model, run the Forecast.ipynb cells.
